The `micronaut-graphql` module comes bundled with Graph__i__QL, an in-browser IDE for exploring GraphQL.

Graph__i__QL must be explicitly enabled via the `graphql.graphiql.enabled` application property.

The following configuration properties can be set:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.configuration.graphql.GraphQLConfiguration$GraphiQLConfiguration.adoc[]

The out of the box rendered Graph__i__QL page does not provide many customisations except the Graph__i__QL version, path and page title.
It also takes into account the `graphql.path` application property,
to provide a seamless integration with the configured GraphQL endpoint path.

If further customisations are required, a custom Graph__i__QL
https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-graphql/blob/serving-over-http/graphql/src/main/resources/graphiql/index.html[template]
can be provided. Either by providing the custom template at `src/main/resources/graphiq/index.html` or via the `graphiql.template-path`
application property pointing to a different template location.
In that case it could also be useful to dynamically replace additional parameters in the template via the `graphql.graphiql.template-parameters`
application property.
